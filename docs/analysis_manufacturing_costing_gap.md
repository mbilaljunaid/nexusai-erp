## 1. Executive Summary
The Manufacturing module currently has **Zero Capability** for Financial Orchestration, WIP Accounting, or Product Costing. While it supports operational execution (Work Orders, Routings), it generates **no financial impact**.

*   **Financial Integration**: ❌ Disconnected from GL.
*   **WIP Tracking**: ❌ Operational only (Qty), no Valuation.
*   **Costing Method**: ❌ Undefined (Standard vs Actual vs Average).
*   **Variance Analysis**: ❌ Non-existent.

**Verdict:** The module is functionally an **Operational Island** and is **NOT Tier-1 Ready** for any finance-integrated workflow.

## 2. Backend Gaps (Entity Level)

| Entity Category | Missing Tier-1 Artifact | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | `mfg_cost_elements` | Cannot classify costs (Material vs Labor vs Overhead). |
| | `mfg_overhead_rules` | Cannot absorb overheads into WIP. |
| | `mfg_standard_costs` | No basis for variance calculation. |
| **Transactions** | `mfg_wip_balances` | Cannot track real-time WIP value. |
| | `mfg_wip_transactions` | No financial audit trail for material issues/completions. |
| | `mfg_variance_journals` | No generation of Purchase Price / Usage / Efficiency variances. |
| **Period Close** | `mfg_period_balances` | Cannot support month-end reconciliation. |
| | `mfg_cost_distributions` | No SLA interface to General Ledger. |

## 3. Frontend Gaps (Zero Coverage)

| Feature Area | Tier-1 Requirement | Status | Gap Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WIP Visibility** | **WIP Valuation Dashboard** | 🔴 Missing | No screen to see "Value of Inventory in Process". |
| **Cost Management** | **Standard Cost & Rollup Workbench** | 🔴 Missing | Impossible to set or view item costs. |
| **Accounting** | **WIP Accounting Monitor** | 🔴 Missing | No visibility into Dr/Cr generated by shop floor. |
| **Period Close** | **Cost Accounting Dashboard** | 🔴 Missing | No month-end checklist or variance inspector. |
| **Variances** | **Variance Analysis View** | 🔴 Missing | Cannot explain why Actual Cost != Standard Cost. |

## 4. Sidebar Reachability Analysis
*   **WIP Evaluation**: ❌ Unreachable (No Route)
*   **Cost Accounting**: ❌ Unreachable (No Route)
*   **Standard Costing**: ❌ Unreachable (No Route)

## 5. Bulk-Data Risk Assessment
*   **WIP Transactions**: Expected Volume: High (10k+ per month). **Risk:** High. Current operational tables may not handle financial aggregation efficiently without summary tables.
*   **Cost Rollup**: Expected Volume: High (All BOMs). **Risk:** High. Recursive SQL logic required; currently missing.

## 6. PR-ENFORCE-001 Governance
*   Since no UI exists, strictly speaking there are no violations, but **standardization is critical** during the build phase to avoid future debt.
*   **Mandate:** All new Costing screens MUST use `StandardTable`, server-side pagination, and `Radix Sheet` for complex inputs.

## 7. Audit Findings Log

| Audit ID | Level | Component | Issue | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AUDIT-CST-001** | L1 | `Backend` | Missing Cost Element & Standard Cost schemas. | 🔥 **CRITICAL** |
| **AUDIT-CST-002** | L6 | `UI` | Missing WIP Valuation Dashboard. | 🔥 **CRITICAL** |
| **AUDIT-CST-003** | L6 | `UI` | Missing Standard Cost Rollup Workbench. | 🔥 **CRITICAL** |
| **AUDIT-CST-004** | L12 | `Logic` | Missing WIP Accounting Engine (Ops -> Finance). | 🔥 **CRITICAL** |
| **AUDIT-CST-005** | L14 | `Complaince`| No Audit Trail for Cost Changes. | 🔥 **CRITICAL** |

## 8. Readiness Verdict
> **Verdict:** 🔴 **NOT READY**
>
> **Remediation Strategy:**
> 1.  Define Level-15 Canonical Architecture (L8 Configuration -> L9 Master Data -> L6 Transaction UI).
> 2.  Implement "Standard Costing" as the MVP costing method (Industry Standard for Discrete Mfg).
> 3.  Build the "Accounting Engine" to translate Ops (Qty) to Finance (Value).
