# 🧠 FA Level-15 Canonical Gap Analysis (RE‑ANALYSIS)

**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Status**: ✅ BUILD APPROVED
**Validation**: Re‑analysis of all levels 1‑15 after Phase 7 completion.

## 1. Delta Changes Since Last Analysis
- No code changes detected since the previous analysis (Phase 7 verification completed). All schemas, services, and workers remain unchanged.

## 2. Updated Feature Parity Heatmap

| Feature Area | Status | Oracle Fusion Parity | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Asset Lifecycle** | 🟢 Ready | Add, Retire, Transfer, Reinstate | Fully operational with approvals. |
| **Depreciation Engine** | 🟢 Ready | STL, DB, Units of Production | Asynchronous background processing. |
| **Asset Books** | 🟢 Ready | Multi‑book (Corp/Tax) logic | Full independent lifecycle tracking. |
| **Lease Accounting** | 🟢 Ready | IFRS 16 / ASC 842 Compliance | Automatic PV calculation & Liability tracking. |
| **Physical Inventory** | 🟢 Ready | Barcode scanning & Reconciliation | Scan history & Mismatch detection. |
| **Reporting** | 🟢 Ready | Roll Forward & Movement Analysis | Standard enterprise reporting active. |
| **Accounting Intel** | 🟢 Ready | Full SLA Integration | All events mapped to Subledger Accounting. |

## 3. Remaining Level‑15 Gaps
- **L1‑L15**: No blockers. All dimensions marked as 🟢 Ready.

## 4. Updated Next‑Step Tasks
- No pending tasks; all roadmap items completed.

## 5. Readiness Verdict
**✅ Build Approved** – All levels 1‑15 are complete and compliant.

# 🧠 FA Level-15 Canonical Gap Analysis (100% PARITY)

**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Status**: 🟢 100% PARITY ACHIEVED
**Validation**: Phases 1-7 Completed & Verified; All L1-L15 Gaps Closed

## 1. Delta Changes & Final Closure
The Fixed Assets module has reached full parity with Oracle Fusion standards through a systematic 7-phase execution:
- **Phase 1-3 (Core)**: Established Multi-Book Architecture, SLA Integration, and Basic STL Depreciation.
- **Phase 4 (AI & Scalability)**: Registered `FA_CREATE_ASSET` and `FA_RUN_DEPRECIATION` as agentic actions (L13) and implemented Asynchronous Background Worker for high-volume processing (L15).
- **Phase 5 (Operational Parity)**: Implemented Asset Transfers (Location/CCID), Reinstatements, and Retirement Approval Workflows (L3, L11).
- **Phase 6 (Compliance & Advanced)**: Delivered IFRS 16 / ASC 842 Lease Accounting with automated PV calculations. Expanded Depreciation Engine to support Declining Balance (DB) and Units of Production (UOP) (L3, L4).
- **Phase 7 (Physical Assets)**: Implemented Physical Inventory tracking, Barcode/QR scan recording, and automated Location Reconciliation (L3).
