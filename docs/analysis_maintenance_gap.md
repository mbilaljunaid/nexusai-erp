- **Meters & Readings**: 🟩 100% (Absolute/Delta, Manual/IoT-ready)
- **Work Definition Library**: 🟩 100% (Operations, Materials, Standard Hours)
- **Preventive Maintenance**: 🟩 100% (Time, Meter, Floating, Hybrid)
- **Work Order Execution**: 🟩 100% (Materials, Resources, Checklists, Permits)
- **Costing & GL Integration**: 🟩 100% (SLA Framework, Balanced Journals)
- **Reliability & RCA**: 🟩 100% (Failure Code Hierarchies, Problem/Cause/Remedy)
- **Asset Health Score**: 🟩 100% (MTBF/MTTR Analytics)
- **Direct Procurement**: 🟩 100% (Purchase Requisitions from Work Orders)
- **Financial Capitalization**: 🟩 100% (Overhaul Cost Adjustments to FA)

## 1. Executive Summary
The NexusAI Maintenance module has transitioned from a task-list manager to a financial-grade asset lifecycle engine. 

### Key Innovations:
1.  **Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)**: Integrated failure analysis and health scoring allow for proactive asset replacement strategies.
2.  **Financial Integrity**: Direct integration with the General Ledger (Phase D) and Fixed Assets (Phase F) ensures maintenance is not just a cost center but a managed investment.
3.  **SCM Symmetry**: Work-order driven procurement (Phase E) eliminates manual re-entry for critical spare parts.
