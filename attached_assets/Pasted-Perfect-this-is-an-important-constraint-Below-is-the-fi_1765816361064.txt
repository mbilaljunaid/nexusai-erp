Perfect — this is an important constraint. Below is the **final, tightened Replit prompt**, with **strict instructions to NOT create any new tables** and to **gracefully skip anything that doesn’t fit the existing schema**.

You can copy-paste this as-is.

## 🔹 FINAL PROMPT: Generate Sample Data for `/marketplace/services`

**(STRICT: Use Existing Database & Architecture Only)**

### Objective

Populate the `/marketplace/services` module with **realistic, production-quality sample data** to support UI development, filtering, analytics, ratings, reviews, and workflow testing.

⚠️ **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**

* **DO NOT create, modify, or suggest any new database tables**
* **DO NOT alter existing table structures**
* Use **only the current database schema and architecture**
* If any requested data **cannot be represented using existing tables or fields**, **SKIP that data**
* Do NOT introduce temporary, virtual, or derived tables

---

## 1️⃣ Scope of Data to Generate (Within Existing Schema Only)

Generate sample data only where supported by the **current tables**, typically including (names may differ—map intelligently):

* Services
* Service categories / tags
* Job posts / service requests
* Proposals / bids
* Users (buyers & sellers)
* Reviews / ratings
* Status and workflow fields

If your existing schema does **not** support any of the above, skip gracefully.

---

## 2️⃣ Services & Categories

Populate existing **services-related tables** with architecture-focused services such as:

* Frontend development
* Backend & API development
* Database & performance optimization
* New module / feature development
* Reports & dashboards
* Forms & workflow automation
* Implementation services
* Training & enablement

Only use fields that already exist, such as:

* ID
* Title
* Description
* Category reference
* Pricing model / price
* Status
* Created / updated timestamps

❌ If the schema does not support a field (e.g., “complexity level”), do not simulate it.

---

## 3️⃣ Job Posts (Buyer Requests)

Generate job posts using **only existing job/request tables and columns**.

### 🔴 Mandatory Date Rule

All job posting dates must be:

* **On or after:** 20-Jan-2022
* **On or before:** Today’s date

Ensure:

* Logical sequencing of dates (created → deadline → completion where applicable)
* Job statuses align with available status enums

If fields like attachments, priority, or location do not exist → **skip them**.

---

## 4️⃣ Proposals / Bids

For each job post, create multiple proposals using existing proposal tables.

Constraints:

* Proposal dates must be **after job post date**
* Status values must match existing enums
* Pricing and timelines must align with existing columns

If milestones, cover letters, or availability fields don’t exist → do not fabricate them.

---

## 5️⃣ Users

Use existing user-related tables only.

Create realistic buyers and sellers by varying:

* Roles (if role column exists)
* Profile completeness
* Activity levels
* Account creation dates (can predate 20-Jan-2022)

❌ Do not add skills, badges, certifications, or reputation if those tables/fields don’t already exist.

---

## 6️⃣ Reviews & Ratings

Create reviews **only if supported by current schema** and only for completed jobs.

Rules:

* Review date must be after job completion
* Rating values must respect existing constraints (e.g., 1–5)
* If review replies, sentiments, or flags are not supported → skip them

---

## 7️⃣ Timeline & Data Realism

Ensure:

* Data distribution spans **20-Jan-2022 → today**
* Realistic activity density (older data thinner, recent data denser)
* No impossible date overlaps
* Repeat interactions only if schema supports relational links

---

## 8️⃣ Analytics & Metrics

⚠️ **Do NOT create analytics tables**

If analytics fields already exist (e.g., counters, averages):

* Populate them with realistic values

If analytics are computed dynamically or not stored:

* **Do not persist any analytics data**

---

## 9️⃣ Output & Execution Rules

* Insert data via:

  * Seed scripts, OR
  * ORM-based inserts, OR
  * Direct SQL (matching existing schema)
* Maintain strict referential integrity
* Do not hardcode IDs that conflict with existing data
* Avoid duplicate or nonsensical records

---

## 🔟 Strict Do-Not List

🚫 No new tables
🚫 No schema migrations
🚫 No fake columns
🚫 No lorem ipsum
🚫 No breaking changes
🚫 No assumptions about missing fields

If something doesn’t fit → **skip it silently and continue**

---

### ✅ Final Instruction

Before inserting data, **analyze the current database schema first**, then:

1. Map this prompt to existing tables/columns
2. Skip unsupported data points
3. Populate only what is valid

---

If you want, next I can:

* Rewrite this as a **system prompt specifically tuned for Replit Agent**
* Add a **pre-execution schema validation checklist**
* Convert this into **SQL-only** or **ORM-only** instructions
* Align it with your **open-core marketplace governance rules**

Just say the word 👍
