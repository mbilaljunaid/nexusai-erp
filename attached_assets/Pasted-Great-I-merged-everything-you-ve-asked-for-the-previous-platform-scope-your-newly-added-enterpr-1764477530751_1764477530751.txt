Great — I merged everything you’ve asked for (the previous platform scope + your newly added enterprise-grade modules from Oracle/Oracle Cloud, full ERP/EPM/SCM coverage, CRM/CX, HR, Industry Clouds, Middleware, Analytics, cross-platform features, and AI-first requirements) into one consolidated, copy-paste ready blueprint.

This is a single authoritative specification you can hand to Replit, dev teams, QA, architects, or product managers. It includes:
	•	Full module list (now complete)
	•	For every major module: all pages/forms that must exist, and for each form a comprehensive field list + validations + AI capabilities + backend notes
	•	Configuration & admin forms for each module
	•	Cross-cutting enterprise features (multi-company, localization, security, compliance)
	•	Middleware/infra and analytics modules you added
	•	“Copy-paste” master Replit prompt snippets at the end for immediate use

NOTE: This is long — it’s a complete requirements document. Use it as your single source-of-truth. If you want me to split into separate files (one per module) or export as a PRD/CSV/ERD, tell me and I’ll generate that next.

31.1 MASTER all-in-one prompt (paste as a single request)

You are an enterprise-grade code generator building the full AI-First Enterprise Platform. Build COMPLETE production-ready modules for everything listed below with full backend, frontend, DB schema, APIs, validations, workflows, tests, and AI integrations. DO NOT produce placeholders or partial pages. For every module create: list of pages, DB DDL, backend microservice (Node.js + TypeScript), API OpenAPI spec, frontend React/Next.js pages & components, CI scripts, unit/integration/UI tests, seed data, and admin configuration UIs. Implement security (RBAC, SSO), multi-tenant isolation, logging, monitoring, backups, and model ops. Modules to build: [paste the full module list from Section 3 here]. Begin by outputting the complete checklist of pages, entities, APIs and tests for the entire system, then ask "Should I begin generating code now?" Wait for confirmation before code.

31.2 MODULE prompt template (run per module — recommended)

MODULE: <module_name> e.g., "CRM - Leads & Opportunities"
Context: Project uses Next.js + Tailwind + Node.js/NestJS + PostgreSQL + Kafka + Milvus. Tenant header 'X-Tenant-Id' required on API calls.
Task: Generate:
1) DB DDL for all entities required for this module (schemas, indexes, FK constraints).
2) Backend microservice: controllers, services, models, validation (Zod/Joi), sample queries, background jobs, event producers (topic names).
3) OpenAPI spec for all endpoints (CRUD + bulk import + export + filters + pagination).
4) Frontend: pages and components (list, detail, create/edit wizard, import UI, attachments, activity feed, Copilot panel stub).
5) Admin config pages for module (custom fields, workflows, approval matrices).
6) Tests: unit tests (Jest), integration tests, Playwright E2E for major flows.
7) AI endpoints: embeddings ingestion, RAG query endpoint, model inference endpoint (with provenance).
8) Seed data (sample 50 records).
9) Acceptance Criteria checklist.
Constraints: Each form must have full fields, validation, error handling, and be connected to backend. No placeholders. Provide code snippets and file layout.

32. DELIVERY & NEXT STEPS (recommended)
	1.	Kick off with a sandbox: run MODULE prompt per high-priority module (Auth, Billing, CRM, Finance, Inventory, Projects).
	2.	Review generated checklist; only then confirm code generation.
	3.	Deploy microservices to staging with CI; run seed data and run tests.
	4.	Add AI model & RAG after core data ingestion (start with retrieval-only LLM actions, keep financial writes manual).
	5.	Run compliance, security, and scale tests.
	6.	Iterate with industry templates per customer.

33. Closing notes & recommendations
	•	Prioritize: Start with auth, billing, CRM, finance, inventory, projects, AI-core. These unlock most customer scenarios.
	•	Data privacy: Keep RAG off for production financial write operations; require explicit tenant opt-in.
	•	Human-in-loop: Default all AI-initiated financial transactions to “suggest & queue” until proven safe.
	•	Model ops: Track model usage per tenant and allocate AI credits to prevent runaway cost.
	•	Documentation: For every generated module, produce an Admin Guide, API Reference, and UAT packs (AI can auto-generate these).

⸻

If you want I will:
	•	Generate the full ERD + SQL DDL for the canonical entities now, or
	•	Produce the first module (Auth + Tenant + Billing) with full code skeletons and tests (module-by-module approach), or
	•	Break this entire doc into downloadable PRD, CSV of forms/fields, and Jira epics.

Which one should I do next?
