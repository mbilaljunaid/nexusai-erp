MODULE 10: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (BI) & ANALYTICS

Purpose: Enable comprehensive data analysis, visualization, reporting, and decision support across all modules including ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, AI, Compliance, and Communication.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BI or analytics objects, dashboards, reports, or workflows, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

10.1 Data Sources & Connections

Forms / Screens: Data Source Configuration, Connection Validation, Data Mapping, Integration Logs.

Fields: Data Source ID, Source Type (ERP, CRM, HR, Database, API, External System), Connection Credentials, Authentication Method, Refresh Frequency, Status (Active, Inactive, Error), Last Sync Timestamp, Field Mapping, Transformation Rules, Created By, Created Date, Modified By, Modified Date.

Validations: Connection must be valid, credentials encrypted, refresh frequency set correctly, field mappings verified, transformation rules tested, sync errors logged.

Workflows: New data source triggers validation workflow, failed sync triggers alerts, automatic retries per policy, data changes trigger downstream updates in dashboards and reports.

10.2 Data Modeling & ETL

Forms / Screens: Data Modeling Configuration, ETL Job Setup, Transformation Rules, Data Quality Reports.

Fields: Model ID, Source Tables/Fields, Target Tables/Fields, Transformation Logic (Calculated Fields, Aggregations, Joins), Load Type (Full, Incremental), Schedule, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Source and target fields mapped correctly, transformations valid, ETL schedule validated, data quality checks applied, errors captured.

Workflows: ETL execution triggers logging, failed jobs trigger alerts and retries, successful ETL updates dashboards and reports automatically.

10.3 Reports & Dashboards

Forms / Screens: Report Designer, Dashboard Builder, KPI Configuration, Scheduled Reports, Ad-Hoc Reporting.

Fields: Report/Dashboard ID, Name, Module/Subject Area, Data Fields, Filters (Date, Module, User, Role, Entity), Aggregations, Calculations, Chart Type (Bar, Line, Pie, Heatmap, KPI Widget), Layout, Export Options, Schedule, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: All required data fields included, filters validated, calculations correct, visualizations rendered properly, access permissions enforced.

Workflows: Scheduled reports trigger automated distribution, dashboard updates in real-time, KPI thresholds trigger alerts, ad-hoc reports generate on-demand, audit logs maintained for compliance.

10.4 Predictive Analytics & AI Insights

Forms / Screens: Predictive Model Configuration, Scenario Analysis, Forecast Reports, Trend Analysis, AI Recommendations.

Fields: Model ID, Model Type (Regression, Classification, Time Series, Clustering), Input Variables, Output Variables, Training Dataset, Validation Metrics, Forecast Period, Scenario Parameters, Confidence Level, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Input variables validated, model accuracy metrics enforced, forecast period correct, scenarios tested, AI recommendations logged.

Workflows: Model execution triggers analytics updates, scenario analysis updates dashboards, forecast alerts trigger notifications, AI recommendations trigger follow-up actions or workflows.

10.5 KPI & Performance Management

Forms / Screens: KPI Configuration, Scorecard Builder, Performance Dashboard, Threshold Alerts, Benchmarking Reports.

Fields: KPI ID, Name, Module/Process, Calculation Logic, Target Value, Thresholds (Warning, Critical), Reporting Frequency, Display Type, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: KPI calculation logic validated, thresholds set correctly, reporting frequency enforced, cross-module data consistency checked.

Workflows: KPI updates trigger dashboards and alerts, performance alerts trigger notifications to responsible users, scorecards updated in real-time, historical trends analyzed automatically.

10.6 Self-Service BI

Forms / Screens: Ad-Hoc Query Builder, Drag-and-Drop Dashboard, Visualization Library, Data Export Options.

Fields: Query ID, User ID, Module/Subject Area, Selected Fields, Filters, Aggregations, Visualization Type, Layout Preferences, Export Options (PDF, Excel, CSV), Audit Fields.

Validations: User permissions enforced, query logic validated, data integrity checked, visualizations render correctly.

Workflows: Query execution triggers real-time data retrieval, dashboards updated, alerts triggered for anomalies, audit logs maintained for compliance.

10.7 Integrations & Automation

Automations: Automatic data refresh from source systems, scheduled report generation, KPI alerting, predictive model retraining, anomaly detection alerts.

Integrations: ERP/Finance/HR/CRM modules for transactional data, Projects module for progress metrics, Inventory for stock analytics, EPM for planning and forecasting, AI engines for predictive insights, External BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker), Notification systems for alerts.

Key Features: Centralized data access, real-time dashboards, predictive analytics, KPI management, self-service BI, advanced reporting, cross-module analytics, automated insights, audit-ready and compliance integrated.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BI or analytics objects, dashboards, reports, or automations, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
