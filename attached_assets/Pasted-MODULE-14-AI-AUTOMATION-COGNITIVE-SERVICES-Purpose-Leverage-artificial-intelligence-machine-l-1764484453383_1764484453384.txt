MODULE 14: AI, AUTOMATION & COGNITIVE SERVICES

Purpose: Leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation to enhance decision-making, predictive insights, process efficiency, and user experience across ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, BI, and Compliance modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any AI, automation, or cognitive services objects, workflows, or integrations, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
