Generating **Industry Pack 14 — FOOD & BEVERAGE (F&B)** now in your exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format.

**TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:**
**Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, or integrations for the FOOD & BEVERAGE Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate, overwrite, or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, augment existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed data operations must be idempotent.**

---

## 19. DEPLOYMENT, MIGRATION & REPLIT EXECUTION GUIDELINES

**Idempotency & Safety**

* Migrations additive only; destructive changes require migration plan & rollback.
* Feature flags for production vs kitchen features per tenant/outlet.

**Testing**

* Run traceability mock recall (end-to-end) test, MRP dry runs, LIMS flows, temp breach simulations, POS order to dispatch tests.

**Rollback**

* Provide rollback scripts for schema changes & seed data; ensure backups before major uploads.

---

## 20. FINAL MANDATE (REPEAT FOR ENFORCEMENT)

**REPLIT MUST** — before creating or modifying any UI, DB schema, API, workflow, integration, sample data, or automation — scan the existing codebase; detect existing implementations; skip or enhance existing functionality only; and **NEVER** duplicate or overwrite objects without explicit migration strategy. All seed/sample data must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
