MODULE 35: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) & PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS

Purpose: Leverage AI and machine learning to provide predictive insights, recommendations, anomaly detection, automation, and decision support across ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, BI, BPM, and Compliance modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any AI or predictive analytics objects, models, workflows, or dashboards, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
