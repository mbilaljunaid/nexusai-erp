Generating Industry Pack 5 — MANUFACTURING (PROCESS / BATCH) now in the exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format you requested.

TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:
Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, integrations, or code for the MANUFACTURING — PROCESS / BATCH Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate, overwrite, or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, augment existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas, and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed data operations must be idempotent.
