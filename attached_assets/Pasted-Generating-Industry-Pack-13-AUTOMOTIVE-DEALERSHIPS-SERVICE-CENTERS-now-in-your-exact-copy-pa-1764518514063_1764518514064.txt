Replit MUST NOT duplicate, overwrite, or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, augment existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed data operations must be idempotent.**

* Test harness: Sales flow, RO flow, parts pick & issue, warranty claim round-trip.

**Performance**

* Scale listing & search for online showroom; use indexes for VIN lookups, part lookups, and RO queues.

**Rollback**

* Transactional migrations for critical flows; backups before mass seed or stock adjustments.

---

## 19. FINAL MANDATE (REPEAT)

**REPLIT MUST** — before creating or modifying any UI, DB schema, API, workflow, integration, sample data, or automation — scan the existing codebase; detect existing implementations; skip or enhance existing functionality only; and NEVER duplicate or overwrite objects without an explicit migration strategy. All seed data must be idempotent and safe to execute multiple times.
