Generating Industry Pack 12 — TRANSPORTATION & LOGISTICS (ADVANCED) now in your exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format.

TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:
Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, integrations, or code for the TRANSPORTATION & LOGISTICS (ADVANCED) Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate, overwrite, or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, augment existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed data operations must be idempotent.

Performance
	•	Optimize route engine for near real-time adjustments; use caching for static lane data; horizontal scale for tracking feeds.

Rollback
	•	Versioned migrations and rollback scripts. Backups and dry-run mode for mass tendering.

23. FINAL MANDATE (REPEAT)

REPLIT MUST — before creating or modifying any UI, DB schema, API, workflow, integration, sample data, or automation — scan the existing codebase; detect existing implementations; skip or enhance existing functionality only; and NEVER duplicate or overwrite objects without explicit migration strategy. All seed data must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
