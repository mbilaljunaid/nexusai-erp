Here’s a clean, **Replit-ready prompt**, with **missing roles added** and the requirement clearly structured so it’s unambiguous for implementation.

---

## Additional user roles you missed (recommended)

To make training access realistic and enterprise-grade, you should also include:

* **End Users / Operational Users**
  (day-to-day users who execute transactions but don’t configure the system)

* **Super Admin (Global / System Owner)**
  (higher than platform admin, for internal Nexus AI First team or core maintainers)

* **Trainer / Content Author (optional but very useful)**
  (users who create, update, and maintain training materials)

You can keep these optional if you want minimal scope, but they are standard in ERP/LMS setups.

## Reworded Prompt for Replit (copy-paste ready)

> **Objective:**
> Implement a role-based training content management and access system.
>
> **Requirement:**
> Training content must be **filterable, role-aware, and permission-controlled**, so that each user only sees training materials that are relevant to their role and responsibilities.
>
> **User Roles to Support:**
>
> * Implementation Partner
> * Business User
> * End User / Operational User
> * Business Analyst
> * Tenant Admin
> * Platform Admin
> * Super Admin (system owner / core team)
> * Trainer / Content Author (if applicable)
>
> **Functional Expectations:**
>
> 1. Each training item (video, document, walkthrough, guide) must be tagged with one or more applicable user roles.
> 2. Users must only be able to view training content mapped to their assigned role(s).
> 3. Tenant Admins should be able to control which training content is visible within their tenant.
> 4. Platform Admins / Super Admins should have visibility across all roles and tenants.
> 5. Training content must support filtering by:
>
>    * User role
>    * Module / feature
>    * Skill level (basic, intermediate, advanced)
> 6. Access rules must be enforced both in the UI and backend (not UI-only filtering).
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * Enhance and reuse existing role management and permission structures.
> * Do **not** introduce a separate training system; integrate within the current application framework.
>
> **Outcome:**
> A scalable, secure, role-based training experience where each user sees only relevant learning content aligned with their role.

If you want, I can also:

* Map **exact training types per role** (e.g., what Business Users vs Analysts see)
* Convert this into **acceptance criteria / user stories**
* Align it with your **ERP role management model** (since you’re building Nexus AI First ERP)

Just tell me what format you want next.
