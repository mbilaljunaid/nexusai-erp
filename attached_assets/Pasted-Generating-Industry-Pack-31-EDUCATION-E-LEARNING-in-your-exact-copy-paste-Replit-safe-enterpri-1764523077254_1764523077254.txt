Generating Industry Pack 31 — EDUCATION & E-LEARNING in your exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format.

TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:
Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, integrations, or code for the Education & E-Learning Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, enhance existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas, and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed/sample data operations must be idempotent.

Testing
	•	Student lifecycle → course → assignments → grading → billing → events → KPI dashboards

⸻

18. FINAL MANDATE (REPEAT FOR EVERY GENERATED ARTIFACT)

REPLIT MUST — before creating or modifying any UI, DB schema, API, workflow, integration, sample data, or automation — scan the existing codebase; detect existing implementations; skip or safely enhance existing functionality only; and NEVER duplicate or overwrite objects without explicit migration strategy. All seed/sample data must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
