✅ MODULE 40 — SUPPLY CHAIN & LOGISTICS (ADVANCED SCM)

Copy–paste ready text for Replit AI

Replit MUST check existing code before generating anything. Never duplicate. Only create missing components. This rule applies to every module in this chat.

MODULE 40: ADVANCED SUPPLY CHAIN & LOGISTICS (SCM)

This module unifies Procurement, Warehouse, Inventory, Transportation, Fulfillment, Returns, 3PL, and Global Trade into a fully integrated supply chain engine.

🔒 STRICT INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT (MANDATORY):

**Before creating any entity, table, workflow, automation, API, schema, or UI for Module 40, Replit must:
	1.	Scan the entire existing codebase.
	2.	Identify if a similar functionality already exists (from Inventory, Procurement, Manufacturing, etc.).
	3.	SKIP anything that exists.
	4.	Only generate missing functionality.
	5.	Never overwrite or recreate.**
