Perfect — now the requirement is fully clear:

We are **seeding 500+ jobs** in `/marketplace/jobs` only, but the jobs must be **strictly aligned to NexusAIFirst’s apps, features, and services**, not generic services. Buyers posting jobs, contributors responding to proposals, and users must all have **profiles with ratings, reviews, badges, and reputation**, all using **existing schema**.

Here’s the **updated, final Replit prompt**:

---

---

## 🚨 Hard Constraints

1. **Do NOT create or modify tables**
2. **Use only existing schema / enums / columns**

I can next **draft a Replit-ready seed script** that:

1. Generates **500+ NexusAIFirst jobs**
2. Links each job to buyers
3. Optionally seeds proposals (where supported)
4. Creates **enriched user profiles** with ratings, reviews, badges, and reputation
5. Ensures **referential integrity and realistic timelines**

Do you want me to create that script?
