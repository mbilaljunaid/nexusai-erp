You are an enterprise-grade code generator tasked with building a full AI-FIRST Enterprise Platform.

The platform must include all modules, forms, backend, DB schema, APIs, validations, workflows, tests, and AI integrations. Implement features at the level of Oracle Cloud ERP + Odoo + Zoho + Salesforce + Jira + PowerBI/Embedded Excel + Industry Clouds.

### 1. Modules to build (all-inclusive):
1. User, Authentication & Access Control
2. Subscription, Billing & Credits Management
3. Demo / Sandbox / Onboarding
4. CRM & CX (Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, CPQ, Campaigns, Territory, Partner Portal, Customer Service, Field Service, Digital Customer Service, Subscription Management, Commerce Cloud, Social Listening, Reputation, Loyalty)
5. Marketing Automation & Commerce
6. Projects, Tasks & PPM (Project Financials, Resource Management, Timesheets, Backlogs, Roadmaps, Billing)
7. Sales, Order Management & Revenue Recognition (OTC)
8. Procurement, Sourcing & Contracts (Self-service, RFQ, Supplier Portal, Contract Lifecycle)
9. Inventory, WMS & Warehouse Cloud
10. Manufacturing (Discrete, Process, Outsourced, MES)
11. Supply Chain Planning & Transportation Management (OTM)
12. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) & Configurator/CPQ
13. Finance & Accounting (GL, AP, AR, Cash, Fixed Assets, Revenue Mgmt, Tax, Consolidation, Account Reconciliation)
14. EPM (Planning, Budgeting, Forecasting, Consolidation, Strategic Modeling, Narrative Reporting, PCMCS)
15. HR & Payroll / HCM (Employee master, Time & Labor, Payroll, Benefits, Compensation, Performance, Learning)
16. Asset Management / EAM / Maintenance
17. Compliance, Audit, Risk & Controls
18. Business Process Management & Automation / Process Mining
19. Integrations & Middleware (API Gateway, Integration Cloud, IDCS, Low-code Visual Builder, Logging, Monitoring)
20. Content Management, Website, CMS, Forms, Chatbots
21. BI & Analytics (PowerBI/Embedded Excel, FAW, GeoAnalytics, ML Insights)
22. Industry Clouds (Banking, Insurance, Telecom, Healthcare, Hospitality, Construction, Retail, Energy & Utilities, Food & Beverage, Public Sector)
23. Admin, DevOps & Environment Management
24. AI-Core: LLM, RAG, Prompt-based Assistance, Self-Healing, Auto-Resolution, Explainable AI, Human-in-loop Approvals

### 2. Requirements per module:
For every module, generate:
1. **All pages / forms** (full enterprise-grade forms, configuration pages, admin pages)
2. **Fields** for each form (with types, validations, computed fields, attachments, dependencies)
3. **Backend endpoints** (REST/GraphQL, request/response schema)
4. **Database schema** (tables, indexes, constraints, relationships)
5. **AI capabilities** (autofill, predictive suggestions, anomaly detection, RAG, LLM assistance)
6. **Permissions / roles** per page/form
7. **Configuration pages/forms** (custom fields, workflows, approval matrices, rules engines)
8. **Business logic workflows** (e.g., approval flows, revenue recognition, inventory replenishment)
9. **UI/UX hints** (wizards, inline validation, tooltips)
10. **Tests**: Unit, integration, E2E (Playwright/Cypress), seed data for UAT
11. **Cross-module integrations** (e.g., Orders → Inventory → Finance → Billing)
12. **Industry templates**: Pre-configured objects, processes, dashboards
13. **Compliance & localization**: multi-currency, multi-language, tax rules, payroll rules
14. **AI-first operations**: predictive alerts, next-best-action, anomaly detection, automation suggestions

### 3. Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS + React Component Library + Copilot Panel on all pages
- Backend: Node.js/NestJS + TypeScript + REST + GraphQL + Event bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- DB: PostgreSQL + Milvus/Weaviate for vector embeddings
- AI: OpenAI or self-hosted LLMs, RAG pipeline, embeddings, prompt templates
- DevOps: Kubernetes, CI/CD, Logging/Monitoring, feature flags, environment cloning

### 4. Constraints & Requirements
- Full multi-tenant isolation per tenant
- RBAC/ABAC permissions enforced everywhere
- All forms connected to backend with validations; no placeholder forms
- Data integrity & consistency across modules
- Audit trails for all transactional changes
- Human-in-loop for financial/critical AI suggestions
- All AI-generated actions must be explainable
- Seed sample data for every module
- Full UAT checklist for each module (configurations, forms, reports, workflows, AI actions)
- Self-healing and auto-diagnosis capabilities in AI core

### 5. Output Instructions
- Provide **full checklist of all forms, fields, endpoints, DB tables, AI features** first
- Once confirmed, generate **module code** with frontend + backend + DB + AI endpoints
- Include **unit, integration, and E2E test scripts**
- Include **seed data & demo scripts**
- Include **configurations and industry templates**

### 6. Deliverables per module:
- DB Schema (DDL)  
- Backend microservice (controllers, services, events)  
- API documentation (OpenAPI/GraphQL)  
- Frontend pages & components  
- Admin/config pages  
- AI endpoints & RAG embeddings  
- Tests & sample data  
- Acceptance criteria

**Task:** Begin generating **full, enterprise-grade platform** for all modules above in one go, ensuring every form is complete, fully validated, AI-enabled, and connected to backend. Include all cross-module integrations and dependencies.
