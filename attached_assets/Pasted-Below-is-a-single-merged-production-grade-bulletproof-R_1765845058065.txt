Below is a single, merged, production-grade, bulletproof Replit prompt you can copy-paste and use as-is.
It is written to force a deep, non-skippable audit, full verification, fixes where needed, and a clear final report.

🔒 MASTER REPLIT PROMPT – FULL CODEBASE DEEP AUDIT & PRODUCTION READINESS CONFIRMATION

You are a senior full-stack engineer and architect with up-to-date knowledge of modern web development.
Always use the latest stable libraries, APIs, and best practices.
Do not use deprecated, experimental, or legacy patterns.

Your task is to conduct a deep, exhaustive audit of the entire existing codebase and confirm full compliance with the requirements below.
This audit is a production-readiness gate — nothing may be assumed; everything must be verified directly in code.

⸻

🔍 1. Scope of Audit (MANDATORY)

Audit every part of the system end-to-end, including but not limited to:
	•	Frontend UI/UX
	•	State management and data flow
	•	API integrations
	•	Backend routes and controllers
	•	Business logic and services
	•	Database models, migrations, and seed data
	•	Authentication and authorization
	•	Configuration and environment setup
	•	Error handling, logging, and observability
	•	Performance, scalability, and security
	•	Open-core vs proprietary boundaries (if applicable)

⸻

✅ 2. Core Engineering Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You must verify and confirm that:
	•	No files, logic, or implementation steps are skipped
	•	No placeholders exist (no TODO, ..., commented stubs, mock logic)
	•	No hard-coded pages, dashboards, cards, reports, forms, or data
	•	All files contain complete, production-ready code
	•	Clean, modular architecture is followed
	•	Frontend uses modern patterns:
	•	Functional components
	•	Hooks
	•	Proper state management
	•	No prop drilling abuse
	•	Backend uses modern standards:
	•	async/await
	•	Proper validation
	•	Clean separation of concerns
	•	Frontend is fully connected to backend
	•	No mocked APIs
	•	No static JSON pretending to be dynamic
	•	All UI pages are fully built, connected, and working
	•	Output must be real, working code — never pseudocode

⸻

🔐 3. Security & Compliance Audit

Perform a full security review and fix issues if found:
	•	Authentication & authorization (RBAC, guards, middleware)
	•	Secure session/JWT handling (expiry, refresh, storage)
	•	OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
	•	Input validation & sanitization
	•	SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
	•	XSS, CSRF, CORS, clickjacking protection
	•	Secure file upload handling (type, size, storage)
	•	Secrets management (no secrets in repo)
	•	Proper environment-based configuration

Explicitly list all security gaps and their fixes in the final report.

⸻

🚀 4. Performance & Scalability Review

Verify and optimize:
	•	Database queries and indexing
	•	N+1 query issues
	•	Pagination, filtering, sorting
	•	Caching strategy (where applicable)
	•	API payload size and response times
	•	Frontend bundle size and code splitting
	•	Lazy loading and memoization

Document bottlenecks and applied improvements.

⸻

🧱 5. Database & Data Integrity Audit

Confirm:
	•	Proper schema design and normalization
	•	Correct relationships and constraints
	•	Migration strategy
	•	Seed data correctness
	•	No hard-coded IDs or magic values
	•	Data consistency across all modules

⸻

🔄 6. State Management & Data Flow

Audit and confirm:
	•	Correct usage of global vs local state
	•	Predictable and consistent data flow
	•	Proper loading, error, and empty states
	•	No duplicated or conflicting state logic

⸻

🎨 7. UI / UX / Accessibility Review

Verify:
	•	Responsive design across breakpoints
	•	WCAG accessibility compliance
	•	Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
	•	Clear validation and error messaging
	•	Proper empty states, loaders, and edge-case handling

⸻

🧪 8. Error Handling, Logging & Observability

Confirm:
	•	Centralized error handling (frontend & backend)
	•	Meaningful API error responses
	•	Logging strategy suitable for production
	•	Monitoring and alert readiness

⸻

🧪 9. Testing & Quality Gates

Audit:
	•	Unit, integration, and E2E test coverage
	•	Critical user flows
	•	Data integrity and security-related paths

If tests are missing or insufficient:
	•	Explicitly list gaps
	•	Recommend concrete test cases

⸻

📦 10. Dependency, License & Maintainability Review

Verify:
	•	No deprecated or vulnerable libraries
	•	License compatibility for commercial use
	•	Clean dependency graph
	•	Long-term maintainability and extensibility

⸻

🧠 11. Architecture & Technical Debt Assessment

Evaluate:
	•	Separation of concerns
	•	Reusability and modularity
	•	Open-core vs proprietary boundaries (if applicable)
	•	Technical debt and refactoring opportunities

⸻

📄 12. REQUIRED FINAL DELIVERABLES (STRICT)

You must produce a complete written audit report containing:

1️⃣ Executive Summary
	•	Overall health of the codebase
	•	Production readiness status

2️⃣ Detailed Findings (by category)
	•	Security
	•	Performance
	•	Architecture
	•	UX
	•	Data integrity
	•	Maintainability

3️⃣ Complete System Inventory

List explicitly:
	•	All frontend pages
	•	All forms and their validations
	•	All backend routes and controllers
	•	All database models and relationships
	•	Frontend ↔ Backend connections

4️⃣ Hardcoded Elements Report
	•	Identify any hardcoded fields, values, or logic
	•	Confirm they were fixed or justify why they exist

5️⃣ Issues & Fixes Log
	•	Issue description
	•	Severity
	•	Resolution applied

6️⃣ Final Compliance Checklist

A yes/no confirmation against every requirement above.

⸻

🛑 Final Instruction (NON-OPTIONAL)

This audit must be treated as a production-readiness gate.
If any requirement is unmet, you must:
	•	Explicitly call it out
	•	Fix it
	•	Document the fix

Do not assume intent. Verify everything in code.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Adapt this for Next.js + Node + Prisma
	•	Adapt it for monorepo or microservices
	•	Tailor it specifically for NexusAIFirst / Brandoye / Flowboard
	•	Create a post-audit remediation prompt

Just tell me.
