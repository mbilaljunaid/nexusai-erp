Great — below is a hands-on, developer-ready enhancement spec you can paste into your Replit AI, hand to dev teams, or drop into tickets. It expands your very basic Replit app into a full AI-first, “Replit of ERP/CRM/PM/EPM” combining (and exceeding) features from Odoo, Oracle, Zoho, Jira, and Salesforce.

I’ve organized it so engineers and AI tools can act on it immediately:
	•	Short overview + priorities
	•	Concrete modules to add/enhance with detailed functional specs (features, UI pages/forms, API endpoints, DB fields)
	•	AI/coprocessor prompts and RAG requirements for each module
	•	Admin, billing, demo, tenant, and admin UX details
	•	Implementation tasks, acceptance criteria, testcases and security/perf notes
	•	Example Replit AI prompt templates (copy/paste-ready) for code-generation, scaffolding, UI, API, tests, and docs

⸻

	•	Contextual Copilot widget on right side (chat + suggested actions).
	•	Inline audit & history on every record.

Module pages
	•	CRM: Account list, Account detail (tabs: Overview, Contacts, Opportunities, Orders, Activities, Invoices), Lead pipeline, Campaigns, Quotes builder.
	•	Projects: Project list, Project board, Issue detail, Sprint planning, Resource planning (calendar).
	•	Finance: Dashboard, Chart of Accounts, Journals list, Invoice list, Reconciliation workspace, Close period checklist.
	•	Inventory: Products list, Stock ledger, Transfer form, Inventory adjustments.
	•	HR: Employees list, Employee profile, Leave approval forms, Payroll run page.

	•	Implement a rules engine (Drools-like or custom) for approvals, automations, and CPQ.
	•	Visual workflow builder that writes to workflow DSL: triggers, conditions, actions.
	•	Examples:
	•	When Invoice > $50,000 → require CFO approval.
	•	If lead score > 80 & opportunity stage = Proposal → auto-assign to Director.
	•	When stock reaches reorder point → create PO draft.

⸻

17 — Acceptance criteria & test cases (sample)

CRM lead conversion
	•	GIVEN a Lead with all mandatory fields, WHEN converted → THEN Opportunity and Contact, Account are created and a Quote draft is produced. Audit entry created.

Issue automation
	•	GIVEN a new issue with severity=Critical AND no assignee → WHEN automation runs → THEN issue assigned to on-call with SLA timer.

Bank reconciliation
	•	GIVEN a bank statement imported with two amounts matching two outstanding payments → WHEN reconciliation is run → THEN both payments matched and GL updated with reconciliation record.

Copilot finance suggestion
	•	GIVEN an email with invoice attachment → WHEN Copilot processes → THEN it suggests a draft invoice with 95% field fill and links to source doc; user must approve to post.

⸻

18 — Security & Compliance (must-have)
	•	Tenant isolation, encryption at rest & transit, audit logs, SSO, least-privilege IAM.
	•	PII detection & redaction in ingestion.
	•	Data locality option per tenant (store in region).
	•	SOC2/GDPR-ready controls built-in for enterprise tenants.

⸻

19 — Performance & scaling considerations
	•	Partition large tables by tenant; shard vector DB by tenant if necessary.
	•	Separate AI inference cluster (GPU) with queue & autoscaling.
	•	Use async ingestion for heavy imports, with DLQ and retry.
	•	Cache frequently used data (pricebooks, product lists) in Redis.

⸻

20 — Example Replit AI prompts (copy/paste ready)

Use these to generate code, components, APIs or tests. Prefix with context “We have a Replit project with Next.js + Express + PostgreSQL”.

A. Scaffold an API microservice

You are a Replit AI coding assistant. Create a Node.js (TypeScript) microservice for "crm" with NestJS/Express that exposes REST endpoints for Accounts, Contacts and Leads. Implement CRUD, pagination, search by name, tenant isolation using tenant_id header, and basic validation with Zod. Include OpenAPI docs and unit tests (Jest). Provide database migration SQL for accounts/contacts/leads. Return folder structure & sample curl commands.

B. Build a Quote Builder React component

You are a frontend engineer assistant. Build a Quote Builder in Next.js using React + Tailwind. Should allow: add line items (product lookup via API), apply discounts, tax calculation, preview PDF, save as draft. Include validation, optimistic UI updates, and sample API integration with /api/quotes route. Provide component, CSS classes, and usage example.

C. Create CPQ rules engine skeleton

Generate a simple rules engine in TypeScript that takes rules JSON and evaluates pricing adjustments for quote line items. Support conditions (e.g., product.category == 'software' AND qty > 10) and actions (apply discount %, set approval_required). Provide tests and example rules.

D. Implement Vector DB ingestion pipeline

Create a Python script to extract text from PDF/Word/Docx, split into chunks, compute embeddings using sentence-transformers, and insert into Milvus with tenant namespace. Include config options for chunk size, overlap, batch size, and error handling.

E. Create Copilot RAG prompt & security wrapper

Create a prompt template and wrapper function (TypeScript) that performs RAG retrieval from Milvus, merges top 5 docs with user query, sanitizes input (PII removal), calls local LLM inference endpoint, and returns response with provenance metadata. Ensure rate-limiting and logging of prompt & model version.

F. Generate UAT test pack

Generate 40 UAT test cases for CRM → Sales workflow from Lead creation to Order fulfillment, covering positive, negative, edge cases and performance scenarios. Provide steps, expected results, sample test data.
