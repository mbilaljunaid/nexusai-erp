Generating **Industry Pack 16 — FASHION, APPAREL & FOOTWEAR** now in your exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format.

**TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:**
**Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, integrations, or code for the FASHION, APPAREL & FOOTWEAR Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, enhance existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed/sample data operations must be idempotent.**

---

## 19. ALERTS, AUTOMATIONS & EXCEPTIONS

**Examples**

---

## 20. DEPLOYMENT & REPLIT EXECUTION GUIDELINES

**Idempotency & Safety**

* Seeders must check natural keys (StyleID + SKU) before insert.
* Migrations additive only; destructive changes require migration & rollback scripts.
* Feature flags per tenant for PLM, marketplace connectors, country size charts.

**Testing**

* Run lookbook → PDP → pre-order → allocate → fulfill → return cycle tests and marketplace mapping tests.

**Rollback**

* Provide reversible migrations and data backups before major seeding or allocation changes.

---

## 21. FINAL MANDATE (REPEAT FOR EVERY GENERATED ARTIFACT)

**REPLIT MUST** — before creating or modifying any UI, DB schema, API, workflow, integration, sample data, or automation — scan the existing codebase; detect existing implementations; skip or safely enhance existing functionality only; and **NEVER** duplicate or overwrite objects without explicit migration strategy. All seed/sample data must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
