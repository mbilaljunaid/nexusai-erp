Below is the **updated, production-grade Replit prompt**, enhanced to **explicitly require 500+ records**, while **still enforcing NexusAIFirst alignment and zero schema changes**.

You can paste this **as-is** into Replit.

# 🔹 FINAL REPLIT PROMPT

## NexusAIFirst Marketplace – High-Volume Data Seeding (500+ Records)

### Context

NexusAIFirst is a **platform-centric, AI-first marketplace** focused on:

* Platform modules & extensions
* Workflow automation
* AI-driven features
* Integrations, analytics, onboarding, and implementation

The marketplace currently shows **only services offered** and lacks **jobs/service requests**.
This task must fix that using **existing architecture only**.

---

## 🚨 Hard Constraints (Strict)

1. **DO NOT create any new database tables**
2. **DO NOT modify existing schema, enums, or relationships**
3. **Use ONLY existing NexusAIFirst tables**
4. If any requested data **cannot fit the current schema → SKIP it**
5. Do NOT introduce placeholder or generic freelancing data

---

## 1️⃣ Volume Requirement (Mandatory)

Seed **at least 500+ total marketplace records**, distributed as follows (approximate, flexible based on schema limits):

* **250–300 Services Offered**
* **200–250 Jobs / Service Requests**
* Proposals, reviews, and relationships created **only if supported**

If the schema supports more, feel free to exceed these numbers.

---

## 2️⃣ Domain Alignment – NexusAIFirst ONLY

### ❌ Do NOT Seed Generic Freelance Services

Avoid:

* Website design
* Logo design
* WordPress setup
* Generic app development
* Marketing or SEO services

### ✅ Seed NexusAIFirst-Relevant Services ONLY

Examples (adapt titles to existing fields):

* NexusAIFirst module development
* Custom workflow & approval automation
* AI-powered analytics & reporting setup
* NexusAIFirst ERP / CRM integration
* Data ingestion & transformation pipelines
* Role-based dashboards & access control
* Performance tuning of NexusAIFirst deployments
* Platform upgrade & migration services
* NexusAIFirst onboarding & enterprise training
* Industry-specific NexusAIFirst implementations

---

## 3️⃣ Services Offered (Supply Side – 250+)

Seed **250–300 services** using existing service tables.

Rules:

* Titles and descriptions must reference **NexusAIFirst**
* Use only existing columns (price, status, timestamps, owner)
* Services must span multiple years
* Created dates must be **between 20-Jan-2022 and today**
* Include:

  * Active services
  * Paused/archived services (if status exists)
  * Multiple services per seller (if allowed)

---

## 4️⃣ Jobs / Service Requests (Demand Side – 200+)

⚠️ **MANDATORY – This is currently missing**

Seed **200–250 job posts** using existing job/request tables.

### Job Themes (NexusAIFirst-Specific)

* Request for custom NexusAIFirst workflow
* AI feature customization
* Platform integration with external systems
* Migration from legacy tools to NexusAIFirst
* Industry-specific implementation (construction, finance, ops)
* Performance optimization & scaling
* Reporting & dashboard setup
* Access control & security configuration

### Date Rules (Strict)

* Job posting dates must be **between 20-Jan-2022 and today**
* Job deadlines/completions must be logically valid

Include:

* Open jobs
* In-progress jobs
* Completed jobs
* Cancelled jobs (if supported)

---

## 5️⃣ Proposals / Responses (If Supported)

If proposal/bid tables exist:

* Seed multiple proposals per job
* Proposal dates must be after job post date
* Status values must respect enums

If proposals are **not supported**, skip entirely.

---

## 6️⃣ Users

Use existing user tables only.

Create:

* Buyers posting NexusAIFirst jobs
* Sellers offering NexusAIFirst services

Ensure:

* Repeat buyers and repeat sellers
* Realistic account age distribution
* Services and jobs linked to valid users

---

## 7️⃣ Reviews & Ratings (Optional – Schema Dependent)

Only seed if schema supports reviews:

* Reviews only for completed NexusAIFirst jobs
* Ratings within allowed constraints
* Review dates after job completion

If not supported → skip completely.

---

## 8️⃣ Timeline Distribution (Important)

Ensure realistic data spread:

* Older, lighter data in 2022–2023
* Gradual growth in 2024
* High activity near current date
* Overlapping jobs and services
* Long-term platform adoption patterns

---

## 9️⃣ Execution Rules

* Inspect current schema before seeding
* Map fields intelligently (do not guess)
* Maintain referential integrity
* Avoid ID collisions
* Use realistic, human-readable content
* No lorem ipsum

---

## 🔟 Success Criteria

After seeding:

* Marketplace shows **hundreds of NexusAIFirst-relevant services**
* Marketplace shows **hundreds of service requests (jobs)**
* Supply & demand are both visible
* Data feels native to NexusAIFirst—not generic freelancing

---

### ✅ Final Instruction to Replit

**Analyze the existing NexusAIFirst codebase and database first.
Then seed 500+ records strictly within existing tables, skipping anything unsupported.**

If you want next, I can:

* Tune this for **Replit Agent “plan → execute → verify” mode**
* Add **post-seed validation queries**
* Create a **safe reseed / rollback strategy**
* Help you design **production-ready demo data scenarios**

Just tell me what you want to do next.
