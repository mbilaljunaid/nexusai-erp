Here’s the **full Internal Techstack Build Plan in plain text format**, ready to share with your team:

---

# INTERNAL TECHSTACK BUILD PLAN — AI-FIRST ENTERPRISE PLATFORM

Goal: Build a full ERP + CRM + HRMS + EPM + Project Management + Analytics + AI + Industry Modules platform without relying on paid third-party services, fully in-house.

---

## 1 — Frontend (UI / UX Layer)

* Web Framework: Next.js (React-based, open-source, SSR & SSG support)
* Styling/UI Components: TailwindCSS + Radix UI / Shadcn
* Charts & Dashboards: Recharts / D3.js / Plotly
* Form Handling: React Hook Form / Formik
* WYSIWYG / Rich Text: Tiptap OSS / Slate.js
* File / Media Management: Self-hosted MinIO or Local Storage
* Notifications: React Toastify / Notistack
* Collaboration Widgets: Self-built components (Chat, comments, notes using WebSockets / WebRTC)

---

## 2 — Backend (API & Services Layer)

* Core Framework: Node.js + NestJS / Express + TypeScript
* API Layer: REST + GraphQL (Apollo Server OSS)
* Job Queue / Async: BullMQ / RabbitMQ OSS
* Event Streaming: Kafka OSS
* Authentication: OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (Self-hosted with Keycloak)
* RBAC / ABAC: Custom middleware, centralized roles and permissions per module

---

## 3 — AI / Machine Learning Layer

* LLM / Chat AI: LLaMA, MPT, Falcon, or other OSS models, fine-tuned internally
* Prompt & Context Management: LangChain / LlamaIndex OSS, self-hosted
* Vector DB / Embeddings: Milvus / Weaviate OSS
* ML & Predictive Analytics: PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn / PyCaret
* AI Orchestration: Prefect / Airflow OSS
* Document / Knowledge AI: Haystack OSS for search, QA, RAG

---

## 4 — Databases & Storage

* Relational DB: PostgreSQL OSS
* NoSQL DB: MongoDB OSS
* Graph DB: Neo4j Community / RedisGraph OSS
* Time-Series / Analytics: TimescaleDB OSS / InfluxDB OSS
* Caching: Redis OSS
* Object Storage: MinIO OSS / Self-hosted S3 compatible
* Data Lake: PostgreSQL + MongoDB + MinIO

---

## 5 — Core Modules

### Integration Layer

* API Gateway, Workflow Automation, Connectors
* AI Features: Auto-field mapping, cross-module workflow automation

---

## 6 — DevOps & Deployment

* Version Control: GitLab / GitHub Enterprise (self-hosted)
* CI/CD: Jenkins / GitLab Pipelines / ArgoCD
* Containerization: Docker
* Orchestration: Kubernetes OSS
* Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault OSS
* Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana OSS, ELK Stack OSS
* Backups: Self-hosted S3 + MinIO / PostgreSQL backups

---

## 7 — AI Training & RAG Pipelines

* Data Collection: Internal transactional, operational, document data
* Embedding Generation: Using open-source LLM / sentence transformers
* Vector Database: Self-hosted Milvus/Weaviate
* Query / Retrieval: Internal Python-based RAG engine
* Prompt Orchestration: LangChain OSS internally
* Feedback Loop: AI learns continuously from user interaction

---

## 8 — Cost-Controlled Strategy

* Avoid OpenAI / Pinecone / PowerBI subscription fees
* Build modular services allowing optional future paid replacements without changing core architecture
* GPU hardware: internal on-prem or cloud-managed clusters you control
* Self-hosting vector DB + LLMs prevents API cost explosion

---

## 9 — Modular & Scalable Architecture

* Microservices per module → independent upgrades & scaling
* API-first design → easy integration with future modules
* AI pipelines separate → scale independently for heavy inference tasks
* Multi-tenant / multi-industry ready → configure workflows per industry

---

### Outcome

* Fully independent platform
* No third-party AI dependency
* All BI, analytics, ERP, CRM, HR, project management, compliance, BPM, and AI features self-hosted
* Scalable, modular, industry-ready, AI-first

If you want, I can **create a text-based architecture diagram** next that maps **all modules, AI layers, microservices, databases, integrations, and front/back-end flows** for your development team.

Do you want me to do that?
