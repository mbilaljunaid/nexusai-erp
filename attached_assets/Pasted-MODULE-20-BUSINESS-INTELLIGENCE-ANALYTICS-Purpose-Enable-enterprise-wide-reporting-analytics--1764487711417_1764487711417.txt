MODULE 20: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & ANALYTICS

Purpose: Enable enterprise-wide reporting, analytics, dashboards, and data-driven decision-making by integrating data from ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, AI, Compliance, and other modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BI or analytics objects, workflows, dashboards, or reports, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
