MODULE 21: BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT (BPM) & WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

Purpose: Model, automate, monitor, and optimize business processes across ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, BI, AI, Compliance, and other modules to ensure efficiency, compliance, and process consistency.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BPM, workflow, or automation objects, forms, or dashboards, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

21.1 Process Modeling & Design

Forms / Screens: Process Designer, Workflow Templates, Task Definition, Role Assignment, Process Simulation Dashboard.

Fields: Process ID, Process Name, Module, Process Type (Operational, Strategic, Compliance), Steps/Tasks, Roles/Participants, Conditions/Rules, Priority, Status, Version, Approval Workflow, Audit Fields.

Validations: Mandatory fields enforced, task sequence logical, roles assigned correctly, conditions and rules validated, version control maintained.

Workflows: New process triggers approval workflow, process simulation validates flow, dashboards reflect real-time process metrics, integration with other modules for data and action triggers.

21.2 Workflow Automation

Forms / Screens: Workflow Builder, Trigger Event Setup, Action Configuration, Condition Rules, Workflow Monitoring Dashboard.

Fields: Workflow ID, Name, Trigger Event (Manual, Scheduled, System Event), Actions (Create, Update, Notify, Approve, Escalate), Conditions, Status, Assigned Roles, Notifications, Approval Workflow, Audit Fields.

Validations: Trigger events validated, actions sequenced correctly, conditions verified, mandatory approvals enforced, duplicate workflows prevented.

Workflows: Trigger-based execution automates tasks, escalations on delays, notifications sent automatically, integration with ERP, CRM, Finance, HR, and Projects modules.

21.3 Task & Approval Management

Forms / Screens: Task Assignment, Task Status Tracking, Approval Request, Escalation Rules, Task Dashboard.

Fields: Task ID, Process ID, Task Name, Assigned User/Role, Due Date, Priority, Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Blocked), Approval Status, Escalation Path, Audit Fields.

Validations: Mandatory fields enforced, deadlines valid, approval rules validated, escalation rules accurate.

Workflows: Task creation triggers notifications, pending approvals escalate automatically, completion updates dashboards, integration with Projects, Finance, HR, and CRM for seamless execution.

21.4 Process Monitoring & Analytics

Forms / Screens: Process Performance Dashboard, Workflow Analytics, SLA Tracking, Bottleneck Identification, KPI Monitoring.

Fields: Process ID, Task ID, Metrics (Cycle Time, Throughput, SLA Compliance, Exceptions), Status, Owner, Alerts, Audit Fields.

Validations: Metrics accurate, SLA thresholds validated, alerts functional, data updated in real-time.

Workflows: Monitoring dashboards update automatically, SLA breaches trigger alerts, bottlenecks flagged, integration with AI and BI for predictive analytics.

21.5 Exception & Escalation Management

Forms / Screens: Exception Log, Escalation Workflow, Resolution Tracking, SLA Alerts Dashboard.

Fields: Exception ID, Process ID, Task ID, Description, Severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical), Status (Open, Escalated, Resolved), Responsible Owner, Escalation Path, Resolution Action, Audit Fields.

Validations: Exception severity validated, responsible owner assigned, resolution recorded, approvals enforced if needed.

Workflows: Exceptions trigger notifications, escalations according to rules, resolution updates dashboards, integration with Compliance, Finance, and Projects modules.

21.6 Integration & Cross-Module Automation

Forms / Screens: Integration Configuration, Event Triggers, Data Mapping, Action Automation, Monitoring Dashboard.

Fields: Integration ID, Source Module, Target Module, Trigger Event, Action(s), Conditions, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Module mappings validated, triggers verified, actions sequenced correctly, duplicate automation prevented.

Workflows: Events in one module automatically trigger actions in others, real-time data synchronization, dashboards update automatically, integration with AI and BI for predictive workflow recommendations.

21.7 Reporting & Compliance

Forms / Screens: Workflow Reports, Process Audit Reports, SLA Compliance Reports, Exception Reports, BPM Dashboard.

Fields: Report ID, Name, Process/Module, Metrics, Filters (Date Range, Process, User, Status), Export Options, Schedule, Audit Fields.

Validations: Data accuracy verified, filters validated, scheduled report execution correct, dashboards reflect real-time data.

Workflows: Scheduled reports trigger notifications, dashboards updated automatically, compliance exceptions flagged, integration with BI and AI modules for advanced analytics.
