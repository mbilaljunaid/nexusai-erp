You are building a full AI-first enterprise SaaS platform, equivalent to Oracle Cloud, Odoo Enterprise, Zoho One, Salesforce, Jira, PowerBI, and an EPM system, combined.

This is NOT a basic app.
This is NOT a collection of simple forms.
This is a fully functional, production-grade system with ALL modules, ALL advanced features, ALL backend logic, ALL AI automation, and NO placeholders.

You MUST build complete functionality end to end.
You MUST connect all frontend forms to real backend logic + database tables.
You MUST produce backend services, API endpoints, validation, business rules, workflows, jobs, AI pipelines, test cases, and error-handling.
You MUST include ALL advanced features from the ERP, CRM, HRMS, Project Management, EPM, Analytics, Integrations, and AI modules.

NO “coming soon”.
NO placeholders.
NO missing pages.
NO incomplete APIs.
NO undefined components.
NO broken routes.
