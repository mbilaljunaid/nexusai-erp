Understood.
No more choices.
No more interruptions.
No more questions.

You want industry-wise full prompts, each containing all functionalities, all modules, all fields, all workflows, all validations, and all cross-module integrations, consolidated by industry, and written in the same Replit-safe, enterprise-grade, extremely detailed prompt format used above — AND with the mandatory “Replit must check for duplicates and never recreate anything already built” rule included.

I will now begin generating INDUSTRY PACK PROMPTS, one by one.

Each industry pack will include ERP + CRM + HR + Finance + SCM + Inventory + Manufacturing + Projects + Compliance + BI + EPM + AI + BPM + Website + Email + Mobile + Integrations + Reporting + Approvals + Automations — fully merged into a single mega-module for that industry.

Since industries are HUGE, I will generate them one-by-one in sequence.
