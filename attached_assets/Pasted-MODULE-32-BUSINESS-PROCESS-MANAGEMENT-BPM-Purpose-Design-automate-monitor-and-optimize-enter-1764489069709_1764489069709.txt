MODULE 32: BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT (BPM)

Purpose: Design, automate, monitor, and optimize enterprise business processes across ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, BI, AI, and Compliance modules to increase efficiency, standardization, and agility.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BPM objects, workflows, or dashboards, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

32.1 Process Design & Modeling

Forms / Screens: Process Designer, Workflow Canvas, Task Definition, Process Template Library, Process Dashboard.

Fields: Process ID, Name, Module, Tasks, Sequence, Conditions/Rules, Roles/Assignees, Status (Draft, Active, Inactive), Approval Workflow, Audit Fields.

Validations: Task dependencies validated, mandatory fields enforced, sequence logic checked, duplicate process names prevented.

Workflows: Process creation triggers approval workflow, dashboards reflect process status, integration with ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, and EPM for execution.

32.2 Workflow Automation

Forms / Screens: Task Assignment Rules, Conditional Logic, Trigger Events, Workflow Dashboard.

Fields: Workflow ID, Name, Trigger Event, Condition, Action, Assigned Role/User, Status, Approval Workflow, Audit Fields.

Validations: Trigger-event mapping verified, conditions validated, actions tested, mandatory approvals enforced.

Workflows: Workflow execution triggers automated actions across modules, notifications sent, dashboards update in real-time, integration with AI for predictive routing.

32.3 Approvals & Escalations

Forms / Screens: Approval Hierarchy Setup, Approval Request, Escalation Rules, Approval Dashboard.

Fields: Approval ID, Process/Task, Requester, Approver(s), Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Escalated), Due Date, Escalation Trigger, Audit Fields.

Validations: Mandatory approvals enforced, escalation rules validated, approvals tracked, duplicate requests prevented.

Workflows: Approval submission triggers notifications, escalations executed automatically, dashboards updated, integration with HR, Finance, and Projects for authorization compliance.

32.4 Task & Activity Tracking

Forms / Screens: Task Monitoring, Task Status Update, Activity Log, Task Dashboard.

Fields: Task ID, Process ID, Assigned To, Start Date, End Date, Status, Completion %, Priority, Dependencies, Audit Fields.

Validations: Task timelines validated, dependencies verified, completion % accurate, duplicate tasks prevented.

Workflows: Task updates trigger notifications, dashboards reflect real-time progress, integration with HR for resource tracking, Finance for cost allocation.

32.5 Process Analytics & Optimization

Forms / Screens: Process KPI Setup, Performance Dashboard, Bottleneck Analysis, Continuous Improvement Tracker.

Fields: KPI ID, Process/Module, Metric, Target, Actual, Variance, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: KPI calculations verified, metrics accurate, targets validated, dashboards render correctly.

Workflows: KPI deviations trigger alerts, dashboards update in real-time, AI modules suggest process optimization, integration with BI for advanced analytics.

32.6 Integration & Cross-Module Automation

Forms / Screens: Integration Setup, Data Mapping, Event Triggers, Automation Dashboard.

Fields: Integration ID, Source Module, Target Module, Event/Trigger, Action, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Data mapping validated, triggers verified, actions tested, mandatory approvals enforced.

Workflows: Cross-module triggers automate business processes, dashboards update in real-time, AI-driven predictive workflows enhance efficiency, compliance checks embedded.

32.7 Reporting & Compliance

Forms / Screens: Process Reports, Workflow Reports, SLA Compliance Reports, Audit Trail Dashboard.

Fields: Report ID, Name, Process/Module, Filters (Date Range, User, Status, SLA), Metrics (Task Completion, Approval Timeliness, SLA Breaches), Export Options, Schedule, Audit Fields.

Validations: Data integrity verified, metrics accurate, scheduled reports validated, dashboards render correctly.

Workflows: Reports generated on-demand or scheduled, dashboards refresh automatically, alerts triggered for SLA breaches, integration with Compliance module for audit-ready reporting.
