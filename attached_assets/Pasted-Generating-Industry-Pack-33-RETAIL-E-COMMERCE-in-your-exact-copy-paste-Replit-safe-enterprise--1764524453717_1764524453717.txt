Generating Industry Pack 33 — RETAIL & E-COMMERCE in your exact copy-paste, Replit-safe, enterprise-grade prompt format.

TOP-LINE MANDATORY FOR REPLIT:
Before creating any screens, DB tables, APIs, workflows, automations, roles, sample data, dashboards, integrations, or code for the Retail & E-Commerce Industry Pack, Replit MUST scan the entire existing codebase and skip any functionality already implemented. Replit MUST NOT duplicate or recreate existing objects. Only generate missing features, enhance existing components safely, and keep all naming, schemas, and identifiers consistent with previously built modules. All seed/sample data operations must be idempotent.
