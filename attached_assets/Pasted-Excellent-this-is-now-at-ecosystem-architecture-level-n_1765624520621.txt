Excellent — this is now at ecosystem-architecture level, not just features.
Below is a complete, consolidated, Replit-ready master write-up that includes ALL previously mentioned points, PLUS a very detailed moderation, anti-spam, and abuse-prevention framework.

This is written so that:
	•	Replit can build the full system
	•	Abuse is designed out by architecture, not just rules
	•	Open-source spirit is protected
	•	Service marketplace credibility is not diluted

You can paste this as a single prompt into Replit.
