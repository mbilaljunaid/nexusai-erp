You have full context of the current Nexus AI First codebase, repository structure, and history.

I want you to design a COMPLETE repository, licensing, and governance strategy to convert and MAINTAIN Nexus AI First as a proper OPEN-CORE project.

BUSINESS INTENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Nexus AI First must be open source ONLY at the core functionality level.
- Public-facing pages, UI layers, documentation portals, blogs, marketplaces (apps & services), billing, payments, community features, moderation tools, recommendation logic, and branding must remain PROPRIETARY.
- Contributors must be able to fork the core and build their own products without access to my commercial platform.
- My proprietary platform must never be accidentally open-sourced now or in the future.

CURRENT STATE:
- The existing GitHub repository already contains a mix of core logic and proprietary files.
- The project is currently public.
- I want to safely restructure without breaking ongoing development.

TARGET STATE:
- One PUBLIC GitHub repository for open-source core
- One PRIVATE GitHub repository for proprietary platform
- Clear, enforceable boundaries between the two
- Clean contributor experience
- Long-term monetization safety
- Investor-grade governance

YOUR TASK:
Provide a COMPLETE STRATEGY covering ALL of the following:

1. CODEBASE CLASSIFICATION
   - Analyze the current folders and files
   - Classify each as:
     a) Open-source core
     b) Proprietary platform
   - Identify ambiguous areas and propose refactoring where needed

2. REPOSITORY RESTRUCTURING PLAN
   - Step-by-step instructions to:
     - Extract core code into a new public repository
     - Move proprietary code into a private repository
     - Handle git history safely
     - Archive or deprecate the existing mixed repository
   - Recommend final folder structures for BOTH repositories

3. LICENSE & LEGAL BOUNDARIES
   - Recommend an appropriate open-source license for the core
   - Specify where licensing notices must exist
   - Draft clear README scope statements
   - Prevent contributors from assuming UI, docs portals, or marketplaces are open source

4. ARCHITECTURAL ENFORCEMENT
   - Define strict interaction rules between open-source core and proprietary platform
   - API, SDK, or package-based integration patterns
   - Explicit rules preventing circular or reverse dependencies
   - Extension and plugin mechanisms that remain safe for open source

5. GITHUB GOVERNANCE
   - Branch strategy and protection rules
   - Pull request and review workflows
   - CODEOWNERS setup
   - Contributor permissions and limitations
   - Internal team workflow for proprietary repos

6. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT & CHANGE CONTROL (CRITICAL)
   - Define a permanent decision framework to classify ALL future features as either:
     a) Core (open source)
     b) Platform (proprietary)
   - Specify architectural and repository checks to prevent accidental leakage of proprietary code
   - Recommend policies, checklists, or automation (CI checks, folder rules, repo linting)
   - Define how future refactors, new modules, or marketplaces must respect this open-core boundary
   - Ensure this strategy is treated as a LONG-TERM RULE, not a one-time migration

7. VERSIONING & DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
   - How proprietary repos consume open-source core versions
   - Release cadence alignment
   - Backward compatibility strategy
   - Breaking-change policy

8. CONTRIBUTOR & ECOSYSTEM MODEL
   - What contributors can and cannot build
   - How external developers can fork the core and build their own UI or marketplaces
   - What Nexus AI will and will not support

9. MIGRATION RISK & MITIGATION
   - Risks during restructuring
   - How to avoid broken builds
   - How to communicate changes to early contributors or users

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Structured sections with clear headings
- Decision tables where useful
- Explicit DO / DO NOT lists
- No marketing or promotional language
- Founder-level clarity suitable for long-term governance

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT suggest keeping proprietary code in branches of a public repository
- Do NOT mix UI, billing, marketplace, docs UI, or branding into open-source code
- Assume this strategy must be enforced for ALL FUTURE UPDATES AND DEVELOPMENTS
