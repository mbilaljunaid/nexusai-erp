MODULE 23: ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (EPM), PLANNING & CONSOLIDATION

Purpose: Enable enterprise-wide financial planning, budgeting, forecasting, consolidation, close, reconciliation, and performance reporting across Finance, ERP, HR, Projects, Inventory, CRM, BI, AI, and Compliance modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any EPM, planning, or consolidation objects, workflows, or reports, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

Validations: Scenario inputs validated, calculations verified, comparisons accurate, approvals enforced.

Workflows: Scenario execution triggers dashboards update, comparison reports generated automatically, integration with AI for predictive simulations, alerts for deviations or anomalies.

23.5 KPI & Performance Tracking

Forms / Screens: KPI Setup, Target Definition, Actual vs Target Tracking, Dashboard, Alert Configuration.

Fields: KPI ID, Name, Module/Entity, Metric, Target Value, Period, Thresholds, Status, Owner, Approval Workflow, Audit Fields.

Validations: Metrics calculation verified, thresholds validated, actuals mapped correctly, dashboard rendering validated.

Workflows: KPI deviations trigger alerts, dashboards update automatically, integration with Finance, Projects, HR, and BI modules for cross-functional performance tracking.

23.6 Reporting & Analytics

Validations: Data integrity verified, filters validated, calculations accurate, scheduled execution validated, permissions enforced.

Workflows: Reports generated on-demand or scheduled, dashboards update in real-time, integration with BI, AI, and Finance modules for insights, anomalies trigger alerts.

23.7 Integrations & Automations

Automations: Automated data submission from subsidiaries, scheduled consolidation, variance alert notifications, KPI alert triggers, scenario simulations, journal postings.

Integrations: Finance/ERP for GL and transaction data, HR for payroll and headcount, Projects for cost allocation, Inventory for material valuation, CRM for revenue data, BI/AI modules for predictive analytics and dashboards, Compliance for audit-ready reporting.

Key Features: Enterprise-wide planning & budgeting, financial consolidation, period close & reconciliation, scenario and what-if analysis, KPI & performance tracking, dashboards & advanced reporting, workflow automation, cross-module integration, AI-enabled predictive insights, audit-ready and compliance integrated.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any EPM, planning, consolidation, or reporting objects, workflows, dashboards, or automations, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
