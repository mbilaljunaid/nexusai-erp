MODULE 4: USER ACTIVITY, AUDIT & COMPLIANCE

Purpose: Track, monitor, and audit all user actions, access, and system activity across all modules including ERP, CRM, HR, Projects, ITSM, Finance, Inventory, Analytics, AI, Website, and Communication to ensure compliance, security, and governance.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any audit objects, workflows, or reports, check the system for existing functionality. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already implemented. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

4.1 User Activity Tracking

Forms / Screens: User Activity Dashboard, Module Access Logs, Screen Access Reports, API Activity Logs, Integration Logs.

Fields: User ID, Role, Date and Time, Module Name, Screen or Form Name, Action Performed (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Approve, Assign, Close, Reopen, Export, Import, View), Record ID, Previous Value, New Value, Device ID, IP Address, Browser, Status (Success, Failed, Error), Duration, Originating System, Workflow Triggered, Automation Triggered.

Validations: All user actions must be captured, timestamps must be accurate, mandatory fields for logging enforced, device and IP recorded for every action, no missing audit records, system enforces log integrity and immutability.

Workflows: Every user action triggers automatic logging, real-time alerts for critical actions (e.g., data deletion, role changes), automatic aggregation for dashboards and reporting, automatic archiving of historical logs, periodic validation of log completeness.

4.2 Audit Trails

Forms / Screens: Field-Level Audit Viewer, Record-Level Change History, Module Audit Reports, Compliance Dashboards.

Fields: Event ID, User ID, Role, Module, Screen/Form, Record ID, Field Name, Previous Value, New Value, Action Type (Create, Update, Delete, Approve, Reject), Timestamp, Device ID, IP Address, Workflow Triggered, Automation Triggered, Audit Notes, Approval Information.

Validations: Every critical field change must be logged, historical changes cannot be deleted or modified, audit records must be linked to user and device, timestamps and sequence verified, audit integrity checks performed automatically.

Workflows: Critical field changes trigger alerts, workflow approvals automatically logged, audit reports generated daily, weekly, and monthly, exceptions or policy violations flagged automatically, audit dashboards updated in real-time.

4.3 Compliance Monitoring

Forms / Screens: Compliance Configuration, Policy Enforcement Rules, SoD Violation Reports, Exception Management, Regulatory Reporting.

Fields: Compliance Rule ID, Description, Module/Process Affected, Trigger Conditions, Exception Flags, Mitigation Steps, Responsible Person, Approval Required, Status (Active, Inactive, Violation), Audit Trail.

Validations: All compliance rules enforced across modules, SoD conflicts detected and reported, exceptions properly flagged and approved, regulatory reporting fields validated, periodic review workflow triggered.

Workflows: Automatic detection of compliance violations, alerts to responsible users and managers, escalation workflow for unresolved violations, automatic integration with audit dashboards, periodic compliance check scheduling, integration with external regulatory systems if needed.

4.4 Security Event Logging

Forms / Screens: Security Events Dashboard, Threat Detection Logs, Alert Configuration, Monitoring Rules, SIEM Integration Logs.

Fields: Event ID, Event Type (Unauthorized Access, Failed Login, MFA Failure, Permission Change, Role Change, Data Export, Data Import), User ID, Role, Module, Screen/Form, Device ID, IP Address, Timestamp, Status (Success, Failed, Alerted), Action Taken, Approval Notes, Workflow Triggered.

Validations: All security-relevant events captured, timestamps accurate, events linked to user, role, and device, critical events generate alerts immediately, events immutable and auditable.

Workflows: Security events trigger real-time alerts to Admin and Security Teams, integration with SIEM or external monitoring tools, periodic report generation, automated response workflows for suspicious activity, escalation for unresolved critical events.

4.5 Reporting & Dashboards

Forms / Screens: Audit Reports, User Activity Reports, Compliance Dashboards, SoD Violation Reports, Security Event Reports, Regulatory Reports.

Fields: Report Name, Report Type, Filters (User, Role, Module, Date Range, Action Type, Device, IP), Data Fields (User, Role, Module, Action, Record, Previous/Current Value, Timestamp, Device, IP, Status), Export Options (PDF, Excel, CSV), Scheduling Options (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), Approval Workflow Fields, Audit Trail.

Validations: Reports must include all relevant fields, filtering must function correctly, export formats validated, scheduled reports triggered accurately, historical reports maintained without loss, access permissions enforced for report viewing.

Workflows: Report generation triggers email or system notification, dashboards updated in real-time, exceptions or violations highlighted automatically, regulatory reports generated on schedule, integration with external compliance tools.

4.6 Automations & Integrations

Automations: Automatic capture of all user actions, auto-trigger alerts for security or compliance violations, automatic audit report generation and scheduling, automated archiving of logs, automated dashboard updates.

Integrations: SIEM systems, External Compliance Systems, ERP/CRM/HR modules for cross-module logging, BI tools for analytics and reporting, Workflow Engines for triggering alerts and remediation actions, Email/Notification Systems for alerts.

Key Features: Complete tracking of all user activity, field-level and record-level audit, real-time compliance monitoring, segregation of duties enforcement, regulatory reporting, security event logging, integration with SIEM and BI tools, automated alerting and dashboards.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any audit objects, workflows, or reports, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate existing functionality. Only generate missing elements or enhancements.
