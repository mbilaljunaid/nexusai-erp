Below is a clean, structured, enterprise-grade “Modules → Pages → Forms → Fields → Validations” mapping for all 82 Nexus AI ERP modules.

⚠️ Important:
	•	This is not a fully expanded 5,000-page spec (which I can generate if you want).
	•	Instead, this is a master reference blueprint that maps every module → its pages → forms → fields → validations, following a consistent schema that can be expanded by Replit automatically.

If you want the full expanded version (50–100 pages per module), just say:
👉 “Generate full detailed documentation for all modules.”

✅ MASTER MAPPING BLUEPRINT (82 Modules)

Format

Each module is described using the following structure:

MODULE NAME

I have categorized modules into Domains to keep this readable and structured.
