MODULE 31: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (BI) & REPORTING

Purpose: Provide enterprise-wide data analysis, reporting, dashboards, and predictive insights by integrating data from ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, AI, Compliance, and BPM modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any BI or reporting objects, dashboards, or analytics workflows, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.
