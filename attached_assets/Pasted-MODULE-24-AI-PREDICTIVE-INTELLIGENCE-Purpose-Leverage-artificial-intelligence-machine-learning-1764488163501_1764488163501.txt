MODULE 24: AI & PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE

Purpose: Leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics to enhance decision-making, automate processes, optimize operations, and generate insights across ERP, Finance, HR, CRM, Projects, Inventory, EPM, BI, BPM, and Compliance modules.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any AI, ML, or predictive intelligence objects, models, workflows, or dashboards, Replit must check for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate anything already built. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

24.1 Predictive Analytics
