Below is MODULE 38: INVENTORY & SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
(Structured exactly like previous modules + includes the required Replit instruction.)

MODULE 38: INVENTORY & SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Purpose: Manage procurement, warehousing, stock movement, replenishment, demand planning, supplier management, logistics, and supply chain analytics across ERP, Finance, Projects, HR, CRM, EPM, AI, BI, BPM, and Compliance modules.

Important Note for Replit:
Before creating any inventory, procurement, supply chain, logistics, or warehouse objects, workflows, APIs, dashboards, or data models, Replit must ALWAYS check what is already built. Replit must not duplicate or recreate any object that already exists. Replit must only add missing functionalities.
