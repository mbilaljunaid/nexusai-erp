MODULE 5: AUTOMATIONS, WORKFLOWS & INTEGRATIONS

Purpose: Define and manage all automations, business workflows, approvals, triggers, and system integrations across all modules including ERP, CRM, HR, Projects, ITSM, Finance, Inventory, Analytics, AI, Website, and Communication, enabling a fully connected and automated enterprise system.

Important Note for Replit: Before creating any workflows, automations, triggers, or integrations, Replit must check the system for existing implementations. Do not duplicate or recreate functionality that already exists. Only create missing elements or enhancements.

5.1 Workflow Engine

Forms / Screens: Workflow Configuration, Workflow Designer, Workflow Activation/Deactivation, Workflow Logs, Workflow Monitoring Dashboard.

Fields: Workflow ID, Workflow Name, Workflow Type (Sequential, Parallel, Conditional, Event-Driven), Trigger Event (Create, Update, Delete, Approve, Reject, Scheduled, System Event, External Event), Modules Affected, Actions (Assign Task, Send Notification, Update Record, Execute Script, Generate Report, Approve/Reject), Conditions (Field-Based, Role-Based, Value-Based, Boolean Logic), Scheduled Execution Time, Recurrence Pattern, Status (Active, Inactive), Audit Fields (Created By, Created Date, Modified By, Modified Date).

Validations: Trigger events must exist, conditions must be logically valid, actions must be executable in the selected module, circular workflow dependencies prevented, mandatory fields enforced, user permissions validated for workflow creation.

Workflows: New workflow creation triggers validation and test execution, workflow updates trigger versioning and audit log, conditional workflows execute actions based on rules, parallel workflows execute multiple actions simultaneously, workflow failures trigger alerts and error handling.

5.2 Automation Rules

Forms / Screens: Automation Rules Builder, Automation Rule Activation, Automation Logs, Automation Exceptions.

Fields: Rule ID, Rule Name, Module, Trigger Event, Conditions, Actions, Execution Priority, Status, Exception Handling Flag, Retry Policy, Audit Fields.

Validations: Automation rules must not conflict with existing rules, mandatory triggers and actions defined, priority conflicts resolved, exception handling defined.

Workflows: Automation execution triggers logging, failures trigger alerts, exceptions handled based on defined policy, recurring automation scheduled, integration with notifications and email systems.

5.3 Approvals & Escalations

Forms / Screens: Approval Configuration, Escalation Rules, Approval Logs, Approval Dashboards.

Fields: Approval ID, Module, Workflow ID, Approver Role/Person, Conditions to Approve, Auto-Approve Flag, Escalation Rules (Time-Based, Condition-Based), Notification Settings, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Approval hierarchies validated, mandatory approvers assigned, escalation rules defined, circular approval loops prevented, system ensures approvals executed according to conditions.

Workflows: Approval triggers notifications to approvers, escalation triggers automatic notifications to next-level approvers, approval completion triggers downstream workflow actions, rejection triggers rollback or alternate workflow, audit logs maintained.

5.4 Integration Engine

Forms / Screens: API Configuration, External System Integration Setup, Integration Logs, Webhook Management, Data Mapping Configuration.

Fields: Integration ID, Integration Name, Source System, Target System, Integration Type (Real-Time, Batch, Scheduled), API Endpoints, Authentication Details, Data Mapping Fields, Transformation Rules, Status, Error Handling Rules, Retry Policy, Audit Fields.

Validations: Source and target systems reachable, data mapping validated, API authentication verified, real-time endpoints monitored, batch jobs scheduled correctly, error handling configured.

Workflows: Integration triggers data transfer or synchronization, errors trigger alerts and retry policies, successful integration logs generated, mapping changes trigger validation, integration failures logged and escalated.

5.5 Event Triggers & Notifications

Forms / Screens: Event Trigger Configuration, Notification Templates, Event Logs, Notification Dashboards.

Fields: Event ID, Event Type (System, User, API, Scheduled), Trigger Conditions, Notification Type (Email, SMS, Push, In-App), Recipient (Role, User, Team), Template ID, Status, Audit Fields.

Validations: Events mapped to valid modules, notification recipients verified, templates assigned correctly, conditions evaluated accurately, notification delivery verified.

Workflows: Event triggers send notifications, failures trigger retry workflows, notifications logged for audit, automated escalations triggered for critical events, periodic monitoring ensures delivery.

5.6 Reporting & Monitoring

Forms / Screens: Workflow & Automation Reports, Integration Status Dashboard, Event Log Reports, Exceptions & Error Reports.

Fields: Report ID, Report Name, Module, Workflow/Automation/Integration/Event Reference, Status, Execution Time, Error Details, Exception Details, User/Role Responsible, Timestamp, Audit Fields.

Validations: Reports include all relevant executions, errors and exceptions captured, historical data preserved, access restricted based on role permissions.

Workflows: Scheduled and on-demand reports generated, dashboards updated in real-time, alerts generated for failures or exceptions, integration with BI tools for analytics.
